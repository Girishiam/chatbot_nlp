Chatbot NLP with PyTorch
Overview
This repository showcases the development of a simple yet effective chatbot utilizing PyTorch and foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning models to understand and respond to user inputs, providing a practical introduction to building intelligent conversational agents.

Features
NLP Fundamentals: Implements essential NLP concepts such as:

Tokenization

Stemming

Bag-of-Words model

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a neural network built with PyTorch to classify user intents based on input queries.

Training Pipeline: Includes scripts for:

Preparing training data

Training the model

Saving and loading the trained model

Interactive Chat Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for real-time interactions with the chatbot.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

PyTorch

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
